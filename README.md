# Rabel Catayoc | CSE 474 Software Quality Assurance | Fall 2024 | Brother Scott Wood

Welcome to CSE 474 - Software Quality Assurance.

Hi, I'm as Rab as my friends call me. I'm taking this class -- CSE 474 -- this FA 2024 Semester. I'm from the Philippines, born and raised. I served a full time mission. I'm in my senior year taking up BS in Applied Technology. I hope to learn about Software Quality Assurance and wished to create my own SQA Plan in this class.
